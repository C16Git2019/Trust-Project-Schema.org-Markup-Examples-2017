# Trust Project JSON Schema for validation

This repository is for collaboratively developed Trust Protocol JSON Schema. 

Targeted users: programmers/developers for internal validation during development, such as automated testing, and for live applications, such as client submitted data. 

The definitions in this schema are inspired by schema.org which is under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (version 3.0): http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/. The annotation and validation is based on the vocabulary defined by http://json-schema.org/ and is currently based on version Draft-04.

We are using this to provide all the object types in the Trust Project. The first three in the intial draft are: NewsMediaOrganization, NewsArticle, and Author. The schemas contain the schema.org fields specific to Trust Project Indicators and can be used to enhance existing schema.org schemas and validators.
